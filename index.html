                    <a>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve and
                        Hidden Path
                        Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years,
                        Global
                        Offensive was released for Windows, macOS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, and for
                        Linux in
                        2014. The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in
                        different objective-based game modes. The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting
                        a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue
                        hostages that the Terrorists have captured.</a>
